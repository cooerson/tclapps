How to convert this application into a starkit
==============================================

It should be noted that the description below leaves out the steps of
aquiring dtp and tcllib. The first is not necessary when reading this
file, you already have the sources. It is assumed that the reader
knows how to perform the second.

==============================================

Only 2 steps are required

1)   tclsh dtp.vfs/main.tcl assemble TCLLIB_DIR

     In the command above TCLLIB_DIR refers to either a source
     directory of tcllib, or an installation of tcllib

     The 'assemble' command determines the locations of textutil and
     doctools and copies the relevant portions into the lib and help
     subdirectories of 'dtp.vfs'.

2)   sdx wrap dtp
