	* ijbridge.tcl: Added facility to identify with FreeNode's
	nickserv as unidentified users cannot send private
	messages. Registered ijtest and ijchain users with nickserv.

2004-12-05  Pat Thoyts  <pat@zsplat.freeserve.co.uk>

	* ijbridge.tcl: Added a map to remove all ASCII < 32 except those
	permitted by XML. Added the stdin reader from version 2. Removed
	the check for history items - tclers MUC now puts a timestamp on
	all messages.

2004-11-17  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ijbridge.tcl: Added catch around the message callback and
	generally try to deal with messages that have missing parts.

2004-11-16  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ijbridge.tcl: Added lots of comments to all the Jabber
	section. Implemented support for reconnecting if the network
	connection goes down. Added some bot commands to the bridge - HELP
	might one day be helpful and "/msg ijchain /msg ircuser message"
	will send a private message to an irc user. They cannot sent one
	back though.
