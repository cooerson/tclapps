	* asteroids.tcl: introduce a sense of scaling, to allow the game
	to adapt to smaller screens.

	* asteroids.tcl: introduce named fonts, colors for items.
	Move the FPS label into the canvas, other code cleanup.

	* asteroids.tcl: Updated version from the wiki with the following:
	- Added a second version of the "gameLoop" proc, provided by Jeff
	  Hobbs.  The original version is not CPU friendly as it just runs
	  the game as fast as it can inside a "while" loop.  Jeff H's mod
	  uses the event loop for processing, and tends to place a much
	  lighter load on the CPU.  Immediately below the two gameLoop procs
	  (gameLoop0 and gameLoop1), you'll need to decide which one you
	  want to use and "rename" one of them to gameLoop. Currently,
	  Jeff H's loop is being used.  If you have any animation problems
	  with either loop, try the other one.  Both seem to provide a
	  similar experience.
	- Score and level info is now *drawn* for a more authentic look
	- Extra ship every 10,000 points
	- Added "Help | About" menu
	- Fixed bug when "High Score" dialog is closed using window decoration
